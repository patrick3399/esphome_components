# ESPHome Components

Custom ESPHome components and device YAMLs for this workspace.

This README is intentionally short: it tracks the YAMLs that exist, which
non-official components are needed, and which external component sources each
device uses.

## Candidate Hardware

Reference notes live under [../ref/hardware/](../ref/hardware/). These devices
do not have baseline YAMLs in this repository yet.

| Vendor | Device | Reference | ESPHome notes |

| Guition | ESP32-S3-4848S040 | [hardware](../ref/hardware/guition/esp32-s3-4848s040.md) | ESPHome built-ins should cover display/touch/relays; relay GPIOs still need confirmation. |
| Guition | JC3636K518 | [hardware](../ref/hardware/guition/jc3636k518.md) | Built-ins cover QSPI display, touch, audio, encoder; note Quad PSRAM and dual-MCU audio path. |
| Guition | JC3636W518 | [hardware](../ref/hardware/guition/jc3636w518.md) | Built-ins cover QSPI display, touch, audio; note Octal PSRAM and V1/V2 mic differences. |
| Waveshare | ESP32-S3-ETH | [hardware](../ref/hardware/waveshare/esp32-s3-eth/esp32-s3-eth.md) | Built-in W5500 Ethernet; GPIO33-37 reserved by Octal PSRAM. |

### Planned Components

None currently.

### Replaced / Archived

These should not be used for new device YAMLs unless there is a deliberate
reason to revive them.

| Component | Replacement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `axp2101` | M5Stack official `axp2101` | Used by CoreS3 SE from `github://m5stack/esphome-yaml/components`. |
| `aw88298` | M5Stack official `aw88298` | Used by CoreS3 SE from `github://m5stack/esphome-yaml/components`. |
| `aw9523b` | M5Stack official `aw9523b` | Used by CoreS3 SE from `github://m5stack/esphome-yaml/components`. |
| `lm75` | ESPHome official `lm75b` | Built-in replacement. |
| `pi4ioe5v6408` | Pending migration | Archived because ESPHome 2026.x pin schema/API changed; still appears in StamPLC YAML and needs cleanup. |
| `rx8130ce` | ESPHome official `rx8130` | Built-in replacement. |

See [../DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md) for the CoreS3 SE decision to use
M5Stack official `axp2101`, `aw88298`, and `aw9523b`.
